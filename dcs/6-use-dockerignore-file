# Continue with the previous dockerfile
# Add a .dockerignore file to the root of the repository excluding all files:
# **/**
#
# Build the Docker image, it will fail, because it will not find the jar-file
#
# Include the jar-file:
# !target/*.jar
#
# Build the image
# You will not notice any difference, creating the Docker image will be slightly faster and you are certain that only intended information can be copied into the Docker image
