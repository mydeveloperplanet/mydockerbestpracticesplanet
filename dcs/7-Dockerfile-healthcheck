# Continue with the previous dockerfile
# Add a health check:
# HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --retries=1 CMD wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/ | grep UP || exit 1
#
# Build the image
# Run the container
# Invoke the actuator health endpoint until the status of the container is unhealthy (should do so after 5 consecutive calls)
#   Invoking the endpoint can be done with the command: curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
#   Checking the status can be seen with: docker ps
#   Also note, that the container is not restarted
