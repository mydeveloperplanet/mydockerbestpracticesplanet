# Build the application in a first build stage using the eclipse-temurin-17-alpine docker image
# Copy the contents of the repository into the docker image (beware that the source directory must be in the context of 'docker build'
# This means that you cannot use '../.' but you need to move the Dockerfile one directory level up.
# Build the application with command: mvn clean package -DskipTests
#
# In the second build stage, use the Dockerfile as previously created, but use the jar-file from the first stage
#
# Build the image (No need to add the build argument. Why?)
# docker build . --tag mydeveloperplanet/dockerbestpractices:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT -f 9-Dockerfile-multistage-build
# Run the container
