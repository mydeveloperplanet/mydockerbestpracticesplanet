# Create a Docker Compose file with 2 services: https://docs.docker.com/compose/
#   the container for dockerbestpractices
#   the container which will perform the restart: https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal
# run the compose file:
#  docker compose -f dcs/8-compose-healthcheck.yml up -d
#
# Invoke the actuator health endpoint until the status of the container is unhealthy (should do so after 5 consecutive calls)
#   Invoking the endpoint can be done with the command: curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
#   Checking the status can be seen with: docker ps
#   Note that the container is restarted (you will notice this because the uptime of the container changes)
#
# Stop the containers:
#  docker compose -f dcs/8-compose-healthcheck.yml down
