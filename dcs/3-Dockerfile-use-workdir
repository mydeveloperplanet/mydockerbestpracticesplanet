# Continue with the previous dockerfile
# Set the /opt/app directory as WORKDIR and remove the mkdir instruction:
# WORKDIR /opt/app
#
# Remove unnecessary /opt/app references
#
# Build the image
# Run the container
# Verify it builds and starts successfully
# You will not notice any difference, only the Dockerfile is more readable
